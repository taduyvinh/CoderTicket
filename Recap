  1. Routes test

  2. Controllers Tests
      - Request spec: preferred by Rails 5, test routes, and a little bit of views.
  3. View test
      - Just give a variable and render: 
      - Usually good for partial (no layout)
  4. Features spec:
  5. Model Test: 
        ".upcoming" => instance methods

  TIPs for TDD:
    Write some test cases, expect some results (behavior), add the method name
  create with exclamation mark: if it cant create, it will crash
  It's better to validate "venue" rather than validate "venue_id"

  FactoryGirl: 
    spec/factories/events.rb
    FactoryGirl.create(:event): make it simple to create event without caring about validations,
